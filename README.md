3. Timeline
4. Analytics

Add ability to initialize collection
users setup their collect then they opt in for the airdrop
twitter: users setup collection and put their address

is 400 a good amount?

Add marketplace?

Set expectations that ill likely make one mosaic per year, distributions might change, owning doesnt guarantee anything

Finish timeline

I am thinkin bout makin an airdrop mechanic for some stuff im makin, basically the issue is we cant airdrop unless people setup their collections for that thing, so im thinkin i create a little portal and have users login to their wallet, setup their collection and then submit something.. like a .FIndThought or something on the airdrop page saying that they opt-in for the airdrop, then i'd random that list of wallets and distribute
